## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed

**Netlify/Vercel:**
- Check build logs for errors
- Ensure all files are committed
- Try redeploying

**GitHub Pages:**
- Wait a few minutes (can be slow)
- Check Actions tab for build errors
- Ensure Pages is enabled in settings

### Game Not Working After Deploy

**Check browser console (F12):**
- Look for red errors
- Common issues:
  - CORS errors (usually not an issue with Three.js CDN)
  - 404 errors for models (OK if using placeholders)
  - GitHub API errors (check token)

### Save & Email Not Working

**GitHub commit fails:**
- Verify token in `main.js`
- Check token has `repo` scope
- Ensure username and repo are correct
- Check token is not expired

**Email not received:**
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify all secrets are set
- Check spam folder
- Verify SMTP credentials
- Test with a different email address

### Models Not Loading

**This is expected if you haven't added models!**
- Game uses colorful placeholders
- To add models, see SETUP.md

**If you added models but they don't show:**
- Check file names match exactly
- Check files are in `/models/` folder
- Check browser console for 404 errors
- Try with smaller model files

## Security Reminders

- [ ] **Never commit GitHub token to public repositories**
- [ ] Consider using environment variables for production
- [ ] Use app-specific passwords for email (never regular passwords)
- [ ] Set token expiration dates
- [ ] Rotate tokens regularly

## Share Your Game!

Once everything is working:

- [ ] Copy your deployment URL
- [ ] Share with friends and family
- [ ] Post on social media
- [ ] Add to your portfolio

**Your URLs:**
- Netlify: `https://______________.netlify.app`
- Vercel: `https://______________.vercel.app`
- GitHub Pages: `https://______________.github.io/veggie-garden/`
