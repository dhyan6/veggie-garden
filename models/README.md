# Vegetable 3D Models

Place your vegetable `.glb` or `.gltf` files in this directory.

## Required Models

The application expects these files:
- `carrot.glb`
- `tomato.glb`
- `broccoli.glb`
- `onion.glb`
- `eggplant.glb`
- `pepper.glb`
- `cucumber.glb`

## Note

If models are not found, the application will use colorful placeholder spheres instead, so the game will still be fully functional!
